This the demo project to learn how to use git and manipulate the code and track changes

Auther : Muhammad Zeeshan

<br>

We added a new file index.html in our project and git showing its status untracked means git cant track newly added file in the project 

<br>
we added some more content in the existing file readme then saved it. Then issued the git status command now this readme file is modifed file for git.

<br>
look we issued the command git add index.html and now it is ready to commit in git beacuse its in staged status


<br>
 We issued the command git add . it means that all the new and modified file add the project and rady to commit


 <br>
 git status after commit command output said you are one comment ahead now means the chnages are fine and saved in local machine but the remote git hub repository still the previous.

 <br>
 On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

<br>
git push is the command that is you to make changes also on the git hub repository

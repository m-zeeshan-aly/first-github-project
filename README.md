Auther : Muhammad Zeeshan

<br>

We added a new file index.html in our project and git showing its status untracked means git cant track newly added file in the project 

<br>
we added some more content in the existing file readme then saved it. Then issued the git status command now this readme file is modifed file for git.

<br>
look we issued the command git add index.html and now it is ready to commit in git beacuse its in staged status


<br>
 We issued the command git add . it means that all the new and modified file add the project and rady to commit
